# Static-Music-Player
A **Static Music Player** web application that allows users to play music from a predefined playlist. The website includes a dynamic, interactive UI where users can control playback, change tracks, and adjust the volume. The background color changes with each track, and the track artwork is displayed alongside the player controls.

## Features

- **Play/Pause**: Toggle between playing and pausing the current track.
- **Next/Previous Track**: Skip to the next or previous track in the playlist.
- **Seek Bar**: Scrub through the current track to a desired point.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the playback volume using a slider.
- **Dynamic Background**: Background color changes randomly with each new track.
- **Track Details**: Display current track name, artist, and artwork.
  
The project uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to build the music player.
